# Stock_Price_Prediction

1. Predicting APPLE stock price using simple LSTM model. (Intitutive and easy to learn model)

2. Data downloaded from nasdaq.com for last 10 year.

3. Learning involves 9 years and 8 months of data and last 4 months of data is being used for testing porpurse. 

4. Model is trained to learn the trend/pattern of stock, rather than actual stock price. 

5. LSTM model of keras library is being used for simplicity.

6. 120 days(6 months) of time units (i.e, previous 6 month of data is being used to predict next stock price)
